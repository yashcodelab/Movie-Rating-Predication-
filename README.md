# Movie-Rating-Predication-
This project is part of the Codesoft Data Science Internship and uses machine learning techniques to predict movie ratings. The goal is to build a model that accurately forecasts movie ratings based on user preferences, metadata, and other influential factors.

ðŸš€ Project Overview-
1. Objective: Predict movie ratings using user and movie-related data.
2. Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
3. Algorithms Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor
4. Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (RÂ²)

ðŸš€ Dataset:-
1. The dataset contains information about movies, user ratings, genres, and other metadata.
2. Key columns include: movie_id, user_id, rating, genre, year, runtime, etc.

ðŸ’» Steps Involved:-
1. Data Collection: Imported dataset from reliable sources.
2. Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, and outliers, and performed data transformations.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends, distributions, and relationships between variables.
4. Feature Engineering: Created new features like average rating per genre, release year effects, etc.
5. Model Building: Trained multiple regression models and tuned hyperparameters for best performance.
6. Model Evaluation: Compared models based on MSE and RÂ² scores to select the best-performing model.
7. Result Interpretation: Interpreted model results and identified key factors influencing ratings.

âœ… Results:-

* The Random Forest Regressor provided the best results with an RÂ² score of 0.85. 
* Important factors influencing ratings included genre, runtime, and user preferences

âœ… Conclusion:-

* This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict movie ratings with high accuracy. The insights gained can be valuable for recommendation systems and for improving user engagement on movie platforms.
